=head1 NAME

MassSpec::ViewSpectrum - Perl extension for viewing a mass spectrum.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MassSpec::ViewSpectrum;

  open PNG, ">mygraphic.png" or die "Unable to open output file\n";
  binmode PNG;

  my @masses = (1036.4,1133,1437,1480,1502);
  my @intensities = (0.1,0.15,0.05,0.10,0.2);
  my @annotations = ('b','w','internal w', '','internal y');

  my $vs = MassSpec::ViewSpectrum->new(\@masses,\@intensities, \@annotations);
  $vs->set(yaxismultiplier => 1.8); # a sample tweak to adjust the output
  my $output = $vs->plot();

  print PNG $output;
  close PNG;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MassSpec::ViewSpectrum - Perl extension for viewing a mass spectrum, e.g.
typically obtained from the fragmentation of proteins or peptides.

At present this is only implemented using GD graphics, but in principle 
this could be subclassed in the future to include alternative graphic
paradigms such as SVG and Tk.

The current implementation uses a mixture of GD::Graph and native GD, since GD::Graph 1.43 fails to draw the required vertical lines correctly.

Negative peak intensity values are permitted; this permits the drawing of "pseudospectra" which, for example, illustrate peaks present in one spectrum but missing in another.

=head2 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item width, height

The width and height of the canvas in pixels.
Default: 500 x 500

=item linewidth

Width of vertical spectra in pixels.
Default: 2

=item ylabeldelta

Offset of annotations on y axis measured in pixels.  This is used to permit some whitespace separation between annotations and peaks.
Default: 4

=item xticknumber

Number of tick marks on X axis.
Default: 5

=item xlabeldelta

Number of pixels for offset of annotations on x axis.
Default: 6

=item yaxismultiplier

A ratio, used to permit vertical room for peak annotations.
Default: 2.0

=item extranegativeheight

For pseudospectra which contain some peaks with negative intensities, this is a fudge factor used to make room for annotations on those peaks underneath those peaks.  This value has the same units as the original spectrum.
Default: 0.1

=item outputformat

One of 'png', 'jpg' or 'gif'.  Your local GD installation might only support a subset of these.
Default: 'png'

=item x_label

The label which appears on the X axis.
Default: 'm/z'

=item y_label

The label which appears on the Y axis.
Default: 'Intensity'

=item title

The title of the graph.
Default: ''

=item peakfontsize

Font size of peak labels; one of 'tiny','small','medium','large'.
Default: 'medium'
